Assignment 12.2 for Rae Crusoe in CSC104. 
**Website Name:**** Ona Got Ice. **
The home page is a combo of products and info about the company and owner. 
The Portfolio page consists of three rows of 3 pictures, examples of course just placeholders. 
The about Us page includes the owner's picture(placeholder), their name, and information about them and the company. It also includes basic contact info for the company. The style is very feminine and has more of a myspace old internet kind of feel, with the boxes and organization of the page.
I also added a picture to the footer for a "company logo", as well as fixed the organization on the portfolio page.
**Disclaimer:**
**This final project is to represent and show my skills pertaining to website building as well as to simulate an experience with a client. This is not a finished website, is not live on the internet and doesnt work for what it entails, it is the bones and should be expected to be as so.**
